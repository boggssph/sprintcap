# Feature Specification: Scrum Master Member Hours Input Table

**Feature Branch**: `024-as-scrum-master`  
**Created**: October 14, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "as scrum master I want to be able to see a table that I can provide values for Support and Incidents (in hours). each row is for each member of the squad. the colum from the right is : Member name, Support and Incidents, PR Review and Others. These columns will aceept numeric values that is in hours (e.g. 2.5 for 2 hours and a half, blank is equal to zero, no negative values) once i take out the focus of the cell, then it save automatically to the database table. The member name is non-editable cell/field. the location for this table is in the Capacity tab, above the existing table and above the line that says "Tickets for <sprint-name>""

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-14
- Q: What happens when multiple Scrum Masters edit the same table simultaneously? ‚Üí A: Last edit wins (overwrite previous changes)
- Q: How are member hours associated with specific sprints? ‚Üí A: Tied to a specific sprint selected by the Scrum Master
- Q: Are there any performance requirements for loading/saving the member hours table? ‚Üí A: immediate
- Q: How should decimals beyond one decimal place be handled (e.g., 2.55)? ‚Üí A: Accept as entered
- Q: What happens if a member is added or removed from the squad after hours have been entered? ‚Üí A: Preserve existing hours for removed members
- Additional clarification: A squad can only be assigned to one Scrum Master at any given time, therefore concurrent updates are not possible.
- Additional clarification: The member hours table is distinct for each sprint, preventing modifications from affecting other sprints.

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Scrum Master, I want to view a table in the Capacity tab that allows me to input hours for each squad member across different categories (Support and Incidents, PR Review, Others), so that I can track and manage team capacity effectively. The table should auto-save changes when I move focus away from a cell, and member names should be non-editable.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a Scrum Master is viewing the Capacity tab for an active sprint, **When** they see the new table above the existing tickets table, **Then** the table displays one row per squad member with columns for Member Name (read-only), Support and Incidents, PR Review, and Others.
2. **Given** a Scrum Master enters a valid numeric value (e.g., 2.5) in any editable column, **When** they move focus away from the cell, **Then** the value is automatically saved to the database.
3. **Given** a Scrum Master leaves an editable cell blank, **When** they move focus away, **Then** the value is treated as 0 and saved.
4. **Given** a Scrum Master attempts to enter a negative value, **When** they try to save, **Then** the system prevents the negative value and shows an error or resets to 0.
5. **Given** a Scrum Master enters invalid input (non-numeric), **When** they move focus away, **Then** the system validates the input and either corrects it or shows an error message.
6. **Given** a Scrum Master enters valid hours, **When** the database save fails due to network issues, **Then** an error message is displayed and the input values are preserved for retry.

### Edge Cases
- When multiple Scrum Masters edit the same table simultaneously, the last edit wins (overwrites previous changes).
- Decimal values beyond one decimal place are accepted as entered.
- If database save fails due to network issues, the system MUST display an error message to the user and retain the unsaved changes in the input field for retry.
- How are existing values loaded when the page refreshes?
- If a member is removed from the squad after hours have been entered, existing hours are preserved.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a table in the Capacity tab above the existing tickets table and the "Tickets for <sprint-name>" line.
- **FR-002**: System MUST show one row per squad member in the table.
- **FR-003**: System MUST include columns: Member Name (read-only), Support and Incidents, PR Review, and Others.
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow editing of numeric values in the Support and Incidents, PR Review, and Others columns.
- **FR-005**: System MUST accept and validate numeric input (including decimals) in editable columns, treating blank as 0 and preventing negative values.
- **FR-006**: System MUST auto-save changes to the database when focus leaves an editable cell.
- **FR-007**: System MUST persist the entered hours data to a database table.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Loading and saving of the member hours table MUST complete in <500ms.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Member**: Represents a squad member with attributes like name and squad association.
- **Member Hours**: Represents the hours allocated per member for different categories (Support and Incidents, PR Review, Others) tied to a specific sprint selected by the Scrum Master.
