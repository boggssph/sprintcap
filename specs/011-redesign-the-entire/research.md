# Research: UI/UX Redesign Technical Approaches

## Current UI Analysis
- **Landing Page**: Clean, Jony Ive-inspired design with minimal elements, white background, centered content, sign-in/sign-out buttons. Must remain unchanged.
- **Internal Pages**: Dashboard, forms (sprint creation, squad creation), admin panels using shadcn/ui components (Button, Input, Select, etc.), Tailwind styling.
- **Navigation**: NavigationMenu component, responsive design.
- **Performance**: Current load times unknown, but target <20ms for pages, <15ms mobile.

## shadcn/ui Component Inventory
Available components for redesign:
- Layout: Card, Sheet, Dialog, Drawer
- Forms: Input, Select, Checkbox, Radio, Textarea, Label
- Navigation: NavigationMenu, Breadcrumb, Pagination
- Data Display: Table, Badge, Avatar, Progress
- Feedback: Alert, Toast (via Sonner), Skeleton
- Overlay: Tooltip, Popover, HoverCard
- Themes: Light/dark mode support, customizable via CSS variables

## Performance Optimization Techniques
- **Bundle Analysis**: Use Next.js bundle analyzer to identify large chunks.
- **Image Optimization**: Next.js Image component for any images.
- **Code Splitting**: Dynamic imports for heavy components.
- **CSS Optimization**: Tailwind purging, minimize custom CSS.
- **Caching**: Browser caching, service worker if needed.
- **Lazy Loading**: Components and routes.
- **Minification**: Ensure production builds are optimized.

## Accessibility Considerations
- Use semantic HTML with shadcn components.
- ARIA attributes where needed.
- Keyboard navigation support.
- Color contrast compliance.
- Screen reader compatibility.

## Mobile Responsiveness
- Tailwind responsive utilities (sm:, md:, lg:).
- Touch-friendly interactions.
- Adaptive layouts for small screens.

## Design Principles Application
- **Minimalism**: Remove clutter, focus on essential elements.
- **Speed**: Prioritize fast interactions, reduce cognitive load.
- **Consistency**: Use shadcn design tokens.
- **User-Centric**: Cater to junior/senior developers with intuitive flows.

## Potential Challenges
- Maintaining existing functionality while redesigning.
- Ensuring <20ms load times (aggressive target, may require significant optimization).
- Balancing creativity with usability.
- Testing redesigned components across devices.

## Recommended Approach
1. Audit current components for redundancy.
2. Prototype new designs using shadcn blocks.
3. Implement performance optimizations incrementally.
4. Test extensively with Playwright E2E tests.
