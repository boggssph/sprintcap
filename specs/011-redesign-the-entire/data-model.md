# Data Model: UI/UX Redesign

No changes to the database schema or data models are required for this UI/UX redesign feature. All modifications are limited to frontend components, styling, and user interface elements.

## Existing Data Models (Unchanged)
- User, Squad, Sprint, Ticket, Assignment, etc. (see prisma/schema.prisma)
- Authentication via NextAuth
- Audit logs and invitations

## UI State Management
- Client-side state for UI interactions (forms, navigation)
- No new server-side data requirements
- Existing API endpoints remain compatible
