# Feature Specification: Redesign the Entire Project UI/UX

**Feature Branch**: `011-redesign-the-entire`  
**Created**: 2025-10-08  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "redesign the entire project UI/UX. Use all your creativity. The users of this project are junior web developers and senior web developers. The UI must be fast, no bullshit. I don't care if it looks like any other SaaS projects out there, you may use the shadcn themes and blocks if you think it fits the design that you have in mind. keep the design of the landing page, i like that because that is clean and inspired by Jony Ive's design principles."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors (junior/senior web developers), actions (redesign UI/UX), data (existing components), constraints (keep landing page, fast, no bullshit, use shadcn if fits)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a junior or senior web developer using SprintCap, I want a complete UI/UX redesign that is fast, intuitive, and free of unnecessary complexity, so that I can efficiently manage sprint capacity planning without distractions, while keeping the clean landing page design that I appreciate.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user (junior or senior developer) accesses the SprintCap application, **When** they view the landing page, **Then** they see the existing clean design inspired by Jony Ive's principles, with no changes to its layout or aesthetics.
2. **Given** a logged-in user navigates to their dashboard, **When** they interact with redesigned UI elements, **Then** all pages load within <20ms and provide clear, streamlined navigation without redundant features.
3. **Given** a Scrum Master creates a sprint, **When** they use the sprint creation interface, **Then** the form is redesigned for speed and simplicity, using shadcn components where they enhance the user experience.
4. **Given** an admin manages invites, **When** they access the admin panel, **Then** the interface is optimized for efficiency, catering to both novice and expert users.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the redesigned UI is accessed on mobile devices? Does it maintain responsiveness and speed?
- How does the system handle users with different levels of web development experience? Are there progressive disclosure features for junior developers?
- What occurs if shadcn themes conflict with the desired design? How are conflicts resolved?
- How does the UI perform under slow network conditions? Are there loading states or optimizations?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST maintain the existing landing page design exactly as is, preserving its clean, Jony Ive-inspired aesthetics and layout.
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a complete UI/UX redesign for all internal pages (dashboards, forms, admin panels) that prioritizes speed and eliminates unnecessary elements ("no bullshit").
- **FR-003**: System MUST ensure all redesigned pages load in <20ms, with no performance degradation compared to the current implementation.
- **FR-004**: System MUST cater to both junior and senior web developers by providing intuitive navigation and progressive complexity where appropriate.
- **FR-005**: System MUST incorporate shadcn/ui themes and blocks where they fit the creative design vision, using best judgement, without being constrained by resemblance to other SaaS projects.
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain all existing functionality while improving the user experience through the redesign.
- **FR-007**: System MUST ensure the redesigned UI is accessible (using best judgement for standards) and responsive across devices.
- **FR-008**: System MUST ensure mobile pages load in less than 15 milliseconds.
- **FR-008**: *Example of marking unclear requirements:*
- **FR-009**: System MUST achieve specific performance metrics [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what are the target load times and performance benchmarks?]

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-08

- Q: What is the acceptable load time for redesigned pages? ‚Üí A: <20ms
- Q: What are the mobile responsiveness requirements for the redesigned UI? ‚Üí A: less than 15 milliseconds
- Q: Which shadcn themes should be used for the redesign? ‚Üí A: use your best judgement
- Q: What accessibility standard should be met? ‚Üí A: use your best judgement
- Q: What specific UI elements should be eliminated to achieve "no bullshit"? ‚Üí A: use your best judgement
