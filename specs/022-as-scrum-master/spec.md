# Feature Specification: Squad Management Updates

**Feature Branch**: `022-as-scrum-master`  
**Created**: October 11, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "as scrum master I want to be able to update the squad. update the squad name, squad alias. new fields in the squad defaults for hours values for each of these scrum activities: Daily Scrum (default 15 minutes) mutiplied by number of working days (Monday-Friday) in the sprint, Team refinement (default 1 hour per week) multiplied by number of weeks in sprint, Review and Demo (default 30 minutes) per sprint, Sprint Planning (default 1 hour per week of sprint, so if the sprint is 3 weeks, then it is 3 hours), Sprint Retrospective (default 30 minutes per week of sprint, so for 3 week sprint it is 1 hour and 30 minutes)."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-11
- Q: How should squad names and aliases be validated (uniqueness, format, length constraints)? → A: Names must be unique per organization, aliases unique per squad, no length/format restrictions
- Q: How do ceremony defaults apply to existing sprints vs new sprints? → A: Defaults apply only to new sprints; existing sprints keep their original ceremony allocations
- Q: How should partial weeks be handled in ceremony calculations? → A: Use exact fractional calculation (e.g., 2.5 weeks = 2.5x ceremony time)
- Q: What specific validation rules apply to time values? → A: Must be positive numbers, no upper limit, decimals allowed (e.g., 0.5 hours)
- Q: Are there any explicit out-of-scope items for this feature? → A: unknown

## Functional Requirements

### Core Functionality
- **FR-001**: Scrum Masters must be able to update squad name with uniqueness validation within the organization
- **FR-002**: Scrum Masters must be able to update squad alias with global uniqueness validation
- **FR-003**: Scrum Masters must be able to configure Daily Scrum ceremony defaults (15 minutes × working days per sprint)

- **NFR-003**: Database queries must complete within acceptable time limits for real-time user experience

### Security
- **NFR-004**: Authentication required for all squad management operations
- **NFR-005**: Role-based authorization must enforce Scrum Master permissions
- **NFR-006**: Input validation must prevent injection attacks and malicious data
- **NFR-007**: Database constraints must prevent data corruption from invalid updates

### Usability
- **NFR-008**: Interface must comply with WCAG AA accessibility standards
- **NFR-009**: Form validation must provide clear, actionable error messages
- **NFR-010**: Changes must be reflected immediately in the user interface
- **NFR-011**: Responsive design must work across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

### Reliability
- **NFR-012**: System must maintain data consistency during concurrent updates
- **NFR-013**: Failed operations must not leave system in inconsistent state
- **NFR-014**: Error handling must gracefully degrade without data loss

## User Stories

### Squad Identity Management
**US-001**: As a Scrum Master, I want to update my squad's name so that it reflects current team composition, ensuring the name is unique within my organization.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- I can access squad settings from the dashboard
- I can edit the squad name field
- I receive immediate validation feedback
- Duplicate names within my organization are rejected
- Changes are saved and reflected across the application

**US-002**: As a Scrum Master, I want to update my squad's alias so that it provides a convenient short identifier, ensuring the alias is unique across all squads.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- I can edit the squad alias field alongside the name
- Global uniqueness is enforced
- Alias format allows alphanumeric characters and hyphens
- Changes sync immediately across all squad references

### Ceremony Configuration
**US-003**: As a Scrum Master, I want to configure Daily Scrum ceremony defaults so that new sprints automatically allocate the correct time based on working days.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- I can set default minutes for Daily Scrum (default: 15)
- System calculates total time as: minutes × working days (Mon-Fri)
- Partial weeks are handled with fractional calculations
- New sprints use these defaults automatically

**US-004**: As a Scrum Master, I want to configure ceremony time defaults for refinement, planning, and retrospective so that new sprints have appropriate time allocations.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- I can set hours per week for Team Refinement (default: 1.0)
- I can set hours per week for Sprint Planning (default: 1.0)
- I can set minutes per week for Sprint Retrospective (default: 30)
- System calculates totals based on sprint duration in weeks
- Decimals are supported for fine-grained control

**US-005**: As a Scrum Master, I want to configure Review and Demo ceremony defaults so that new sprints allocate fixed time per sprint regardless of duration.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- I can set fixed minutes for Review and Demo (default: 30)
- Time allocation is constant per sprint, not scaled by duration
- Setting applies to all future sprints for the squad

### Data Integrity & Validation
**US-006**: As a Scrum Master, I want validation feedback when entering invalid ceremony times so that I can correct errors before saving.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Negative values are rejected with clear error messages
- Zero values are rejected (must be positive)
- Non-numeric input is prevented
- Form provides real-time validation feedback

**US-007**: As a Scrum Master, I want partial updates to work correctly so that I can modify only ceremony settings without affecting squad identity.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- I can update only ceremony fields without changing name/alias
- I can update only name/alias without changing ceremony defaults
- Unchanged fields retain their current values
- Update timestamp reflects the change time

## Edge Cases

### Calculation Scenarios
- **EC-001**: Sprint spanning weekend boundaries - working days calculation excludes Saturday/Sunday
- **EC-002**: Partial week sprints (e.g., 2.5 weeks) - ceremony times calculated with fractional multipliers
- **EC-003**: Single-day sprints - minimum working days calculation handles edge case
- **EC-004**: Very long sprints (8+ weeks) - calculations remain accurate without overflow

### Validation Boundaries
- **EC-005**: Squad name with special characters - validation allows reasonable characters
- **EC-006**: Extremely long squad names/aliases - system handles without truncation issues
- **EC-007**: Concurrent updates to same squad - database constraints prevent conflicts
- **EC-008**: Network interruption during save - user state preserved, operation can be retried

### Business Logic
- **EC-009**: Changing defaults mid-sprint - only affects future sprints, not current
- **EC-010**: Squad reassignment - ceremony defaults follow squad, not individual members
- **EC-011**: Organization with many squads - uniqueness validation scales appropriately
- **EC-012**: Historical sprint data - remains unaffected by default changes

## Out of Scope

- Bulk squad operations (multi-squad updates)
- Squad creation/deletion (existing functionality)
- Historical sprint ceremony modifications
- Advanced reporting on ceremony time usage
- Integration with external calendar systems
- Automated ceremony time suggestions based on team size
- Custom ceremony types beyond the standard Scrum ceremonies
