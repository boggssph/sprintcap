# Feature Specification: Capacity Plan Tab for Scrum Masters

**Feature Branch**: `021-as-scrum-master`  
**Created**: 2025-10-10  
**Status**: Clarified  
**Input**: User description: "as scrum master i need to be able to click on the Capacity Plan tab. It will then show me all the capacity plans for each of the squads for the active sprints. each of the capacity plan will be inside its own card. in each of the tab i will be able to trigger the CRUD of the jira tickets."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-10
- Q: What constitutes a "capacity plan" in relation to sprints and tickets? ‚Üí A: each sprint have capacity plan
- Q: What determines if a sprint is considered 'active' for capacity planning purposes? ‚Üí A: Sprints that have been explicitly marked as active by the Scrum Master

---

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Description provided and parsed successfully
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actor: Scrum Master
   ‚Üí Action: Click "Capacity Plan" tab
   ‚Üí Data: Capacity plans for active sprints by squad
   ‚Üí UI: Each capacity plan in separate card
   ‚Üí Functionality: CRUD operations for Jira tickets within each card
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí "Capacity plan" concept clarified - each sprint IS a capacity plan
   ‚Üí "Active sprints" - how is "active" determined? ‚Üí Sprints explicitly marked as active by Scrum Master
   ‚Üí Relationship between capacity plans and ticket CRUD now clear
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flow identified
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Requirements are testable and specific
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Sprints, Tickets, Squads are key entities
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí All critical ambiguities clarified
   ‚Üí No implementation details found
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Scrum Master, I need to access a "Capacity Plan" tab that displays all active sprints for my squads, where each sprint (capacity plan) is contained in its own card, and within each card I can perform full CRUD operations on the associated Jira tickets.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am logged in as a Scrum Master, **When** I click on the "Capacity Plan" tab, **Then** I should see all capacity plans for active sprints across all my squads
2. **Given** I am viewing the Capacity Plan tab, **When** there are multiple squads with active sprints, **Then** each capacity plan should be displayed in its own separate card
3. **Given** I am viewing a capacity plan card, **When** I interact with it, **Then** I should be able to create, read, update, and delete Jira tickets associated with that capacity plan
4. **Given** I am a Scrum Master with no active sprints in my squads, **When** I access the Capacity Plan tab, **Then** I should see an appropriate empty state message

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a Scrum Master has access to multiple squads with overlapping active sprints?
- How does the system handle capacity plans that have no tickets yet?
- What happens if a sprint becomes inactive while the Scrum Master is viewing its capacity plan?
- How are capacity plans ordered or sorted within the tab?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a "Capacity Plan" tab accessible to Scrum Masters
- **FR-002**: System MUST display all active sprints (capacity plans) across all squads where the user is a Scrum Master
- **FR-002a**: System MUST determine active sprints as those explicitly marked as active by the Scrum Master
- **FR-003**: System MUST present each active sprint (capacity plan) in its own separate card
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow Scrum Masters to perform Create operations for Jira tickets within each capacity plan card
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow Scrum Masters to perform Read operations to view existing Jira tickets within each capacity plan card
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow Scrum Masters to perform Update operations for Jira tickets within each capacity plan card
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow Scrum Masters to perform Delete operations for Jira tickets within each capacity plan card
- **FR-008**: System MUST restrict access to capacity plans only to Scrum Masters of the respective squads
- **FR-009**: System MUST show an appropriate empty state when no active sprints exist for the Scrum Master's squads

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Capacity Plan**: A sprint that is currently active, displayed as a card containing associated Jira tickets with CRUD capabilities
- **Sprint**: Time-boxed period of work that belongs to a squad, has active/inactive status that can be set by the Scrum Master
- **Squad**: Team unit led by a Scrum Master, contains members and has associated sprints
- **Jira Ticket**: Work item with attributes like ID, hours, work type, assigned to squad members within sprints
