# Feature Specification: Sprint Creation for Squads

**Feature Branch**: `004-as-scrum-master`
**Created**: September 28, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "as scrum master I can create sprint for a specific squad. i can set the sprint name, sprint start date with time, sprint end date with time. and the sprint members will default to any members in the squad with active status."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-28
- Q: Should overlapping sprints be allowed for the same squad? ‚Üí A: B (Prevent overlapping sprints - Block creation if dates conflict with existing sprints)
- Q: How should the system handle sprint creation for squads with no active members? ‚Üí A: C (Allow silently - Create sprint without any special messaging)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Scrum Master, I want to create a sprint for a specific squad so that I can organize work periods and track team progress. I need to specify the sprint name, start date and time, and end date and time. The sprint should automatically include all active members of the selected squad as sprint participants.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am a Scrum Master with access to multiple squads, **When** I select a squad and create a sprint with name, start/end dates, **Then** the sprint is created and all active squad members are automatically added as sprint participants
2. **Given** I am creating a sprint, **When** I enter invalid dates (end before start), **Then** the system prevents creation and shows an appropriate error message
3. **Given** I am creating a sprint, **When** I select a squad with no active members, **Then** the sprint is created but shows a warning about empty sprint membership
4. **Given** I have created a sprint, **When** I view the sprint details, **Then** I can see all sprint information including name, dates, and participating members

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a squad member becomes inactive after sprint creation?
- How does the system handle overlapping sprints for the same squad?
- What happens if sprint dates conflict with existing sprints?
- How are sprint members updated if squad membership changes during the sprint?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Scrum Masters MUST be able to create sprints for squads they own
- **FR-002**: System MUST require sprint name, start date/time, and end date/time during creation
- **FR-003**: System MUST validate that end date/time is after start date/time
- **FR-004**: System MUST automatically include all active squad members as sprint participants
- **FR-005**: System MUST associate sprints with specific squads
- **FR-006**: System MUST prevent creation of sprints with overlapping dates for the same squad
- **FR-007**: System MUST display sprint information including name, dates, and participating members
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow sprint creation for squads with no active members

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Sprint**: Represents a work period with name, start/end dates, associated squad, and participating members
- **Squad**: Group of team members that sprints are created for
- **Sprint Member**: Individual team member participating in a sprint (defaults to active squad members)
