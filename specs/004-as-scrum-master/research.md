# Research & Technical Decisions: Sprint Creation for Squads

## Overview
This research phase identifies technical approaches and resolves unknowns for implementing sprint creation functionality in the sprintCap application.

## Research Findings

### Decision: Sprint Data Model Design
**Chosen Approach**: Extend existing Prisma schema with Sprint and SprintMember models
- Sprint model: id, name, startDate, endDate, squadId, createdAt, updatedAt
- SprintMember model: id, sprintId, userId, createdAt (junction table for many-to-many relationship)
- Sprint belongs to Squad (many-to-one)
- Sprint has many SprintMembers (one-to-many)
- SprintMember belongs to User (many-to-one)

**Rationale**: 
- Maintains consistency with existing Squad and SquadMember patterns
- Supports future sprint management features (capacity planning, burndown charts)
- Enables efficient queries for sprint membership and squad-sprint relationships

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Embed sprint data directly in Squad model (rejected: violates single responsibility, limits future features)
- Use JSON field for sprint members (rejected: poor query performance, data integrity issues)

### Decision: Date/Time Handling
**Chosen Approach**: Use JavaScript Date objects with ISO string storage in database
- Frontend: HTML datetime-local inputs for user input
- Backend: Validate date ranges and prevent overlaps
- Storage: PostgreSQL timestamp fields with timezone awareness

**Rationale**:
- Native JavaScript Date support in Next.js/React
- Consistent with existing Prisma date handling
- Enables proper timezone handling and date arithmetic

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Use date-only fields without time (rejected: requirements specify date AND time)
- Third-party date libraries (rejected: adds complexity, native Date is sufficient)

### Decision: Overlap Prevention Strategy
**Chosen Approach**: Database-level validation with application checks
- Check for overlapping date ranges before insertion
- Use database constraints where possible
- Return clear error messages for conflicts

**Rationale**:
- Prevents data integrity issues
- Provides immediate user feedback
- Aligns with clarified requirement (FR-006)

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Allow overlaps with warnings (rejected: contradicts clarified requirements)
- Client-side only validation (rejected: insufficient for concurrent users)

### Decision: Sprint Member Auto-Population
**Chosen Approach**: Automatic population on sprint creation using database query
- Query active squad members when creating sprint
- Create SprintMember records for all active users
- Handle empty squads gracefully (allow creation per FR-008)

**Rationale**:
- Ensures data consistency
- Supports future member management features
- Clear audit trail of sprint membership

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Lazy population on first access (rejected: delays error detection)
- Manual member selection (rejected: contradicts "defaults to any members" requirement)

### Decision: API Design Pattern
**Chosen Approach**: RESTful API with standard CRUD operations
- POST /api/sprints - Create sprint
- GET /api/sprints - List sprints for user's squads
- GET /api/sprints/[id] - Get sprint details
- PUT /api/sprints/[id] - Update sprint (future feature)
- DELETE /api/sprints/[id] - Delete sprint (future feature)

**Rationale**:
- Consistent with existing API patterns in the codebase
- Supports future sprint management features
- Clear separation of concerns

**Alternatives Considered**:
- GraphQL API (rejected: overkill for this feature, existing codebase uses REST)
- RPC-style endpoints (rejected: less discoverable, harder to test)

### Decision: UI Integration Approach
**Chosen Approach**: Extend existing Scrum Master dashboard
- Add "Create Sprint" section to existing dashboard
- Use existing shadcn/ui components for consistency
- Integrate with existing squad selection patterns

**Rationale**:
- Maintains UI consistency
- Leverages existing authentication and routing
- Minimal disruption to existing user workflows

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Separate sprint management page (rejected: adds navigation complexity)
- Modal-based creation (rejected: better as dedicated section for data entry)

### Decision: Validation Strategy
**Chosen Approach**: Multi-layer validation
- Client-side: Immediate feedback for required fields and date formats
- Server-side: Business rule validation (overlaps, permissions)
- Database: Constraint enforcement for data integrity

**Rationale**:
- Provides best user experience with immediate feedback
- Ensures security and data integrity
- Follows defense-in-depth principle

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Database-only validation (rejected: poor user experience)
- Client-only validation (rejected: easily bypassed, security risk)

## Technical Dependencies Identified

### Existing Dependencies (Already Available)
- Next.js App Router for API routes and pages
- Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL schema
- NextAuth for user authentication and role checking
- shadcn/ui components for consistent UI
- Tailwind CSS for styling

### New Dependencies (May Be Needed)
- Date validation utilities (can use native Date or add lightweight library)
- Form validation (can use existing patterns or add react-hook-form)

## Integration Points

### Database Integration
- Extend existing schema.prisma with Sprint and SprintMember models
- Create migration for new tables
- Update existing queries if needed

### Authentication Integration
- Use existing session-based authentication
- Check for SCRUM_MASTER role before allowing sprint creation
- Associate sprints with scrum master's squads

### UI Integration
- Add sprint creation form to existing Scrum Master dashboard
- Use existing squad selection dropdown
- Follow existing error handling and success messaging patterns

## Performance Considerations

### Query Optimization
- Index sprint dates for overlap checking
- Use efficient queries for squad member retrieval
- Consider pagination for future sprint listing features

### Scalability
- Support reasonable number of sprints per squad (10-20 active)
- Handle concurrent sprint creation requests
- Plan for future features like sprint archiving

## Security Considerations

### Authorization
- Only Scrum Masters can create sprints for their squads
- Users can only view sprints for squads they belong to
- Input validation prevents malicious data injection

### Data Privacy
- Sprint data contains no sensitive personal information
- Standard database access controls apply

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Date validation logic
- Overlap detection algorithms
- Permission checking functions

### Integration Tests
- Full sprint creation workflow
- Overlap prevention scenarios
- Authentication and authorization

### E2E Tests
- Complete user journey from dashboard to sprint creation
- Error scenarios and edge cases

## Migration Strategy

### Database Migration
- Add Sprint and SprintMember tables
- Populate with any existing sprint data if applicable
- Ensure backward compatibility

### Code Migration
- Update existing dashboard to include sprint creation
- Add new API endpoints
- Update any affected components

## Risk Assessment

### Medium Risks
- Date/time handling across timezones
- Concurrent sprint creation conflicts
- Performance with large squads

### Mitigation Strategies
- Use UTC storage with proper conversion
- Database-level constraints and optimistic locking
- Query optimization and pagination

## Conclusion

The research phase has identified a clear technical approach for implementing sprint creation functionality. The chosen solutions align with existing codebase patterns, constitutional requirements, and business needs. All major technical decisions have been documented with rationale and alternatives considered.
