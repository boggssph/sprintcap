# Data Model: Squad Creation Drawer Width Consistency

**Date**: October 9, 2025
**Feature**: 017-modify-the-drawercontent

## Overview

This feature involves UI consistency improvements only. No data model changes are required.

## Existing Entities

**Squad Creation Form** (from feature spec):
- Fields: squad name (string), squad alias (string)
- Validation: Existing form validation rules unchanged
- State: Form state managed by existing React form handling

## Impact Assessment

- **No new entities**: Feature modifies existing UI component styling
- **No schema changes**: Database schema remains unchanged
- **No data migrations**: No data transformation required
- **Existing validations**: All current form validations preserved

## UI Component State

**Drawer Component**:
- Responsive behavior: Full-screen on mobile, constrained width on desktop
- CSS classes: `max-h-[85vh] lg:max-w-7xl lg:mx-auto`
- No state changes: Existing drawer open/close logic unchanged

## Conclusion

This feature is purely presentational with no data model implications. All existing entities, validations, and data flows remain intact.</content>
