# Quickstart: Squad Creation Drawer Width Consistency

**Date**: October 9, 2025
**Feature**: 017-modify-the-drawercontent

## Overview

This guide validates that the squad creation drawer maintains consistent width constraints with the Scrum Master dashboard UI.

## Prerequisites

- SprintCap application running locally or deployed
- Scrum Master user account with dashboard access
- Multiple screen sizes for testing (desktop, tablet, mobile)

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Desktop Width Consistency
**Given** a Scrum Master is viewing the dashboard on a screen ≥1024px wide
**When** they open the "Create New Squad" drawer
**Then** the drawer content should be constrained to max-width 7xl and centered
**And** the drawer should match the width constraints of other dashboard elements

### Scenario 2: Mobile Responsiveness
**Given** a Scrum Master is viewing the dashboard on a screen <1024px wide
**When** they open the "Create New Squad" drawer
**Then** the drawer should take full available width (no max-width constraint)
**And** the drawer should function as a full-screen overlay on mobile devices

### Scenario 3: Form Functionality Preservation
**Given** the drawer width constraints are applied
**When** a Scrum Master fills out the squad creation form
**Then** all form fields should remain fully functional
**And** form submission should work as before
**And** validation messages should display correctly

## Validation Steps

1. **Desktop Testing**:
   - Resize browser to ≥1024px width
   - Navigate to Scrum Master dashboard
   - Click "Create New Squad" button
   - Verify drawer content is centered and constrained
   - Compare drawer width with dashboard content areas

2. **Mobile Testing**:
   - Resize browser to <1024px width
   - Open squad creation drawer
   - Verify drawer takes full width
   - Test on actual mobile device if possible

3. **Cross-browser Testing**:
   - Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
   - Verify consistent behavior across browsers
   - Check responsive breakpoints work correctly

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Drawer width matches dashboard constraints on large screens
- ✅ Drawer removes constraints on small screens
- ✅ Form functionality remains intact
- ✅ No visual regressions in drawer appearance
- ✅ Responsive behavior works across all screen sizes

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Drawer appears too narrow on desktop
**Solution**: Check that `lg:max-w-7xl lg:mx-auto` classes are applied correctly

**Issue**: Drawer doesn't go full-width on mobile
**Solution**: Verify `lg:` prefix on responsive classes, ensure base styles allow full width

**Issue**: Form fields are cut off or misaligned
**Solution**: Check that existing padding and spacing are preserved</content>
