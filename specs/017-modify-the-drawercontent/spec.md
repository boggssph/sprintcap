# Feature Specification: Squad Creation Drawer Width Consistency

**Feature Branch**: `017-modify-the-drawercontent`
**Created**: October 9, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Modify the DrawerContent in SquadCreationDrawer.tsx to include max-w-7xl mx-auto classes for consistent width constraints with the rest of the Scrum Master dashboard UI."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-09
- Q: How should the drawer behave on screens smaller than the maximum width constraint? → A: Remove the max-width constraint entirely on small screens (< 1024px)

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Feature involves UI consistency improvement for squad creation drawer
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: Scrum Masters (actors), squad creation (action), drawer width (constraint)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → No unclear aspects - change is specific and well-defined
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Clear user flow: Scrum Masters create squads via drawer
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Single requirement: drawer width must match dashboard constraints
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   → Squad creation form data (name, alias)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → No uncertainties, no tech details beyond what's needed
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Scrum Master, I want the squad creation drawer to have consistent width constraints with the rest of the dashboard so that the interface feels cohesive and professional.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a Scrum Master is viewing the dashboard, **When** they open the "Create New Squad" drawer, **Then** the drawer content should not exceed the same maximum width as other dashboard elements
2. **Given** a Scrum Master is using a wide screen display, **When** they open the squad creation drawer, **Then** the drawer should be centered and constrained like other dashboard content

### Edge Cases
- What happens when screen width is smaller than the maximum constraint? (Remove max-width constraint entirely on screens < 1024px to ensure usability)
- How does this affect mobile/tablet views? (Drawer takes full available width on small screens)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The squad creation drawer MUST have the same maximum width constraints as the Scrum Master dashboard content
- **FR-002**: The squad creation drawer MUST be centered horizontally when width constraints are applied
- **FR-003**: The squad creation drawer MUST maintain responsive behavior on smaller screens
- **FR-004**: On screens smaller than 1024px, the squad creation drawer MUST remove the maximum width constraint entirely

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Squad Creation Form**: Contains squad name and alias fields for creating new squads
