# Tasks: Squad Creation Drawer Width Consistency

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/017-modify-the-drawercontent/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   → Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: Each file → contract test task
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: models, services, CLI commands
   → Integration: DB, middleware, logging
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests?
   → All entities have models?
   → All endpoints implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Web app**: `components/`, `e2e/`, `test/`
- Paths shown below assume web application structure per plan.md

## Phase 3.1: Setup
- [x] T001 Verify existing dependencies and project structure

## Phase 3.2: Tests First (TDD) ⚠️ MUST COMPLETE BEFORE 3.3
**CRITICAL: These tests MUST be written and MUST FAIL before ANY implementation**
- [x] T002 [P] Integration test for desktop width consistency in e2e/drawer-width-desktop.spec.ts
- [x] T003 [P] Integration test for mobile responsiveness in e2e/drawer-width-mobile.spec.ts
- [x] T004 [P] Integration test for form functionality preservation in e2e/drawer-form-functionality.spec.ts

## Phase 3.3: Core Implementation (ONLY after tests are failing)
- [x] T005 Modify DrawerContent className in components/SquadCreationDrawer.tsx to add responsive width constraints

## Phase 3.4: Integration
- [x] T006 Verify drawer behavior across different screen sizes and browsers

## Phase 3.5: Polish
- [x] T007 [P] Unit tests for drawer component styling in test/components/SquadCreationDrawer.test.tsx
- [x] T008 Update component documentation if needed
- [x] T009 Run quickstart validation scenarios

## Dependencies
- Tests (T002-T004) before implementation (T005)
- T005 before integration (T006)
- Integration (T006) before polish (T007-T009)

## Parallel Example
```
# Launch T002-T004 together:
Task: "Integration test for desktop width consistency in e2e/drawer-width-desktop.spec.ts"
Task: "Integration test for mobile responsiveness in e2e/drawer-width-mobile.spec.ts"
Task: "Integration test for form functionality preservation in e2e/drawer-form-functionality.spec.ts"
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task
- UI-only change with no new dependencies or API modifications

## Task Generation Rules
*Applied during main() execution*

1. **From Contracts**:
   - No new contracts (UI-only change)
   
2. **From Data Model**:
   - No new entities (existing Squad Creation Form unchanged)
   
3. **From User Stories**:
   - Each story → integration test [P]
   - Quickstart scenarios → validation tasks

4. **Ordering**:
   - Setup → Tests → Core → Integration → Polish
   - Dependencies block parallel execution

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked by main() before returning*

- [x] All contracts have corresponding tests (N/A - no new contracts)
- [x] All entities have model tasks (N/A - no new entities)
- [x] All tests come before implementation
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task</content>
