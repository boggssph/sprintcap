# Research: Squad Creation Drawer Width Consistency

**Date**: October 9, 2025
**Feature**: 017-modify-the-drawercontent

## Research Questions & Findings

### Current Implementation Analysis

**Question**: How is SquadCreationDrawer.tsx currently implemented?

**Findings**:
- Located at `/Users/fseguerra/Projects/sprintCap/components/SquadCreationDrawer.tsx`
- Uses shadcn/ui Drawer components (Drawer, DrawerContent, DrawerHeader, DrawerTitle, DrawerTrigger)
- Current DrawerContent has `className="max-h-[85vh]"` but no width constraints
- Contains a form with squad name and alias fields
- Used in Scrum Master dashboard for creating new squads

**Decision**: Modify the className to include responsive width constraints
**Rationale**: Aligns with dashboard consistency requirements
**Alternatives Considered**: Custom CSS, wrapper div (rejected for simplicity)

### Dashboard Width Pattern Analysis

**Question**: How does CenteredContainer.tsx implement the max-w-7xl mx-auto pattern?

**Findings**:
- Located at `/Users/fseguerra/Projects/sprintCap/components/CenteredContainer.tsx`
- Uses `className="w-full max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8"`
- Provides consistent width constraints and horizontal centering
- Used by ScrumMasterHeader and dashboard layout components
- Includes responsive padding adjustments

**Decision**: Apply similar pattern to DrawerContent with responsive behavior
**Rationale**: Maintains UI consistency across dashboard components
**Alternatives Considered**: Different max-width values (rejected to match existing pattern)

### Responsive Drawer Behavior

**Question**: What are best practices for responsive drawer behavior in shadcn/ui?

**Findings**:
- shadcn/ui Drawer automatically becomes full-screen on mobile (< 768px)
- Desktop behavior: Side drawer with backdrop
- For width constraints: Apply to DrawerContent, not Drawer container
- Responsive classes: Use Tailwind's lg: breakpoint for 1024px+ screens
- Remove constraints on smaller screens to ensure usability

**Decision**: Use `lg:max-w-7xl lg:mx-auto` classes for responsive behavior
**Rationale**: Follows shadcn/ui patterns and meets responsive requirements
**Alternatives Considered**: Fixed width constraints (rejected for mobile usability)

## Technical Approach

**Implementation Strategy**:
1. Add `lg:max-w-7xl lg:mx-auto` to existing DrawerContent className
2. Preserve existing `max-h-[85vh]` for height constraint
3. Test responsive behavior across screen sizes
4. Ensure no impact on mobile drawer functionality

**Dependencies**:
- shadcn/ui Drawer components (already in use)
- Tailwind CSS responsive utilities (already available)
- No additional packages required

**Testing Considerations**:
- Visual regression testing for drawer appearance
- Responsive testing across breakpoints
- Accessibility testing for drawer interactions
- Integration testing with existing form functionality

## Risk Assessment

**Low Risk**: CSS-only change with no functional impact
**Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing of drawer behavior across devices
**Rollback**: Simple removal of added CSS classes if issues arise</content>
