# Research: Stack Squad Cards Vertically with Member List

## Research Findings

### Data Model Analysis
**Decision**: Use existing squad and member data structures already implemented in Neon database
**Rationale**: Clarification confirmed that squad member relationships are already implemented in the database
**Alternatives Considered**: No alternatives needed - existing data model is sufficient

### UI Layout Patterns
**Decision**: Change from CSS Grid (`md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3`) to single-column vertical stack
**Rationale**: Provides better readability for member lists and simpler responsive behavior
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Horizontal scrolling cards (rejected: poor mobile UX)
- Accordion-style expandable cards (rejected: adds complexity without clear benefit)

### Member List Display
**Decision**: Display all members within each card with scrollable container for large lists
**Rationale**: Provides complete visibility of squad composition while handling varying squad sizes
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Pagination (rejected: fragments member view)
- "Show more/less" toggle (rejected: adds interaction complexity)

### Mobile Responsiveness
**Decision**: Maintain vertical stacking on all screen sizes with full-width cards
**Rationale**: Simplifies responsive design and ensures consistent UX across devices
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Different layouts per breakpoint (rejected: increases complexity)
- Horizontal cards on larger screens (rejected: inconsistent with vertical member lists)

### Performance Considerations
**Decision**: No performance optimizations needed for this UI-only change
**Rationale**: Existing API and component performance is already optimized
**Alternatives Considered**: Virtual scrolling (rejected: overkill for max 25 members)

## Technical Approach
- Modify `SquadsTab.tsx` to change grid layout to vertical stack
- Update card content to include member list with join dates
- Add scrollable container for member lists exceeding card height
- Ensure mobile-first responsive design
- Maintain existing card styling and interactions</content>
