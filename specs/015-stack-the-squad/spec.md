# Feature Specification: Stack Squad Cards Vertically with Member List

**Feature Branch**: `015-stack-the-squad`  
**Created**: October 9, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "stack the squad cards vertically. inside each card will list all the members of the squad with the date joined opposite to the member name."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-09
- Q: How should squad member data be structured and accessed? ‚Üí A: already implemented in Neon database
- Q: What happens when a squad has many members (10+)? ‚Üí A: Show all members in a scrollable list within the card
- Q: How should empty squad cards be displayed? ‚Üí A: Show card with "No members yet" message
- Q: Any limits on squad size or member count? ‚Üí A: Hard limit of 25 members per squad
- Q: How does the vertical layout adapt on mobile devices? ‚Üí A: Same vertical stacking, cards full width

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Scrum Master, I want to see squad cards stacked vertically so I can easily scan through all squads, and within each card I want to see all the members of that squad along with when they joined, so I can quickly understand squad composition and member tenure.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a Scrum Master is viewing the Squads tab, **When** there are multiple squads, **Then** the squad cards should be displayed in a single vertical column instead of a grid layout
2. **Given** a Scrum Master is viewing a squad card, **When** the squad has members, **Then** all members should be listed within the card with their name and join date displayed opposite each other
3. **Given** a Scrum Master is viewing a squad card, **When** the squad has no members, **Then** the card should display a "No members yet" message

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a squad has many members (10+)? All members shown in a scrollable list within the card
- How should member names be displayed if they are very long?
- What happens when a squad has no members? Show card with "No members yet" message
- How should the layout adapt on mobile devices? Same vertical stacking with full-width cards

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Squad cards MUST be displayed in a vertical stack layout instead of a grid
- **FR-002**: Each squad card MUST display all members of that squad within the card
- **FR-003**: For each member, the system MUST display the member name and join date with name on the left and join date on the right (formatted as MM/DD/YYYY)
- **FR-004**: Squad cards MUST maintain their current visual design and information (name, alias, member count, creation date)
- **FR-005**: The member list MUST be clearly distinguishable from other card content by using a visual separator (border or background color difference)
- **FR-006**: When a squad has 5 or more members, all members MUST be displayed in a scrollable list within the card
- **FR-007**: When a squad has no members, the card MUST display a "No members yet" message
- **FR-008**: Squads MUST be limited to a maximum of 25 members (enforced at data level, UI handles gracefully)
- **FR-009**: On mobile devices, squad cards MUST use vertical stacking with full-width cards

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Page load times MUST remain under 20ms for squad display
- **NFR-002**: Mobile page load times MUST remain under 15ms for squad display

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Squad**: Represents a team with name, alias, creation date, and collection of members (already implemented in Neon database)
- **Squad Member**: Represents a person in a squad with name and join date (already implemented in Neon database)

## Constraints & Tradeoffs

- **Squad Size Limit**: Hard limit of 25 members per squad to maintain UI performance and readability
