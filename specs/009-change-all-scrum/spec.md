# Feature Specification: Change Scrum Master UI to Basic Centered Navigation

**Feature Branch**: `009-change-all-scrum`  
**Created**: 2025-10-08  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "change ALL scrum master UI to basic UI styling, extremely basic because right now it is overlapping all over the place. I want the shadcn navigation menu to be placed at the center just below the header.. let's start with this basic UI/ UX and then let's iterate from there."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Scrum Master, I want the Scrum Master dashboard UI to be clean and uncluttered so I can reliably access navigation and controls without overlapping elements obstructing content.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the Scrum Master navigates to the dashboard, **When** the page loads, **Then** the shadcn navigation menu is centered horizontally and placed immediately below the header and does not overlap other page elements.
2. **Given** the navigation menu is visible, **When** the window is resized to common viewports (mobile, tablet, desktop), **Then** the menu remains visible, centered below the header, and does not overlap the main content (it may stack vertically on small screens).
3. **Given** a submenu is opened, **When** a user interacts with menu items, **Then** submenu items are displayed in a simple list with adequate spacing and do not overflow or overlap other UI controls.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when page header height is dynamic (different auth states or banners)? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: should menu always be fixed relative to header bottom or flow below content?]
- How should the menu behave for very small viewports (<360px)? (likely: collapse to a simple icon + slide-down list) [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- Accessibility: keyboard navigation and screen reader labels must be preserved.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The Scrum Master dashboard MUST render a single top navigation menu centered horizontally and positioned immediately below the header.
- **FR-002**: The navigation menu MUST use measurable spacing and typography rules to avoid overlap. Conformance criteria (examples):
   - Use Tailwind tokens: horizontal gap between menu items should be `gap-x-4` (or equivalent) on desktop; list item font-size should be `text-sm` and line-height `leading-6` unless a design token overrides these values.
   - Touch targets must be at least 44x44px on mobile viewports.
   - No bounding-box intersection between the nav and main content at desktop breakpoints: automated tests should assert intersection area == 0 px for nav vs page content bounding rects at 1024px and 1280px widths.
   - Submenu spacing: submenu list items should have vertical spacing `space-y-2` and not overflow their container.
- **FR-003**: Submenus MUST open inline below their parent menu item (or in a simple stacked list) and must not overlap header or page content.
- **FR-003**: Submenus MUST open inline below their parent menu item (or in a simple stacked list) and must not overlap header or page content.
- **FR-004**: On viewports narrower than a breakpoint (e.g., 640px), the menu MUST collapse to a single control (hamburger) that expands a vertical list; items must remain readable and non-overlapping.
- **FR-005**: The implementation MUST preserve existing keyboard navigation and ARIA semantics used by the current shadcn navigation menu. Acceptance criteria (automated where possible):
   - The hamburger control must have `aria-label` describing purpose (e.g., "Toggle navigation") and an `aria-expanded` attribute that toggles between `true`/`false` when the menu opens/closes.
   - Menu lists must use semantic roles (e.g., `role="menubar"` for desktop list and `role="menu"` for popover/mobile list) where appropriate and include `aria-controls` where needed.
   - Keyboard interactions: ArrowRight/ArrowLeft move focus between top-level items on desktop; Enter or Space activates/open items; Escape closes open submenus and returns focus to the trigger; Tab order must be preserved. Add unit/integration tests that simulate these keys.
   - Automated axe checks (jest-axe) should run in CI or be explicitly enabled locally to assert no detectable violations for common rules (e.g., aria-roles, aria-expanded, contrast).
- **FR-006**: The change MUST be low-risk visually: it should adjust layout and CSS only, without changing business logic, links, or data flows.

*Ambiguities / Clarifications required*
- **FR-007**: The responsive collapse breakpoint is set to 640px (Tailwind `sm`). Tests must assert behavior at 640px and at a larger breakpoint such as 1024px (md) where applicable.
- **FR-008**: The navigation menu MUST be sticky on desktop (viewport >= collapse breakpoint) and flow with page content on smaller viewports (mobile). Tests must assert sticky behavior on desktop and flowing behavior on mobile.

### Key Entities *(UI-focused, not data)*
- **Scrum Master Header**: The top region (logo, title, top-level controls). Key attributes: height, presence of banners.
- **Centered Navigation Menu**: A presentational component consisting of a horizontal list (desktop) or collapsible control (mobile) directly below the header.

## Implementation Notes (for planning only)
- Suggested initial approach: adjust styles for the Scrum Master dashboard pages only. Move the navigation menu container into a layout region under the header and apply simple centering CSS (flexbox) and spacing utilities. Keep interactions identical; reflow only.
- Suggested acceptance testing: manual visual check on desktop/tablet/mobile plus automated snapshot tests for the main dashboard page at three breakpoints.

## Open Questions / Next Steps
1. Confirm responsive breakpoints (mobile collapse point). [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
2. Sticky behavior decision recorded: sticky on desktop, flow on mobile (tests must validate both behaviors).
3. Decide whether the change should be applied globally to all pages that use the shadcn navigation menu or scoped to Scrum Master pages only.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-08
- Q: Apply changes only to Scrum Master pages (limit edits) or globally to shared component? ‚Üí A: C (Apply to Scrum Master pages now, create follow-up task to mirror globally later)
- Q: Should the menu be sticky under the header or flow with content? ‚Üí C (Sticky on desktop only; flow on mobile)

Applied clarification:
- Scope decision: This feature will be implemented only for Scrum Master dashboard pages initially. A follow-up task will be created to apply the same basic styling globally to the shared shadcn navigation menu at a later time.
- Menu behavior decision: The navigation menu will be sticky on desktop (viewport >= collapse breakpoint) and flow with page content on smaller viewports. Update tests to validate behavior with varying header heights.
