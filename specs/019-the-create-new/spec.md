# Feature Specification: Update Create New Sprint Drawer

**Feature Branch**: `019-the-create-new`  
**Created**: 2025-10-09  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "The "Create New Sprint" drawer and the forms needs updating such that it will look like the "Create New Squad" drawer. Change the max width of the "Create New Sprint" drawer to 768px. In that form, the dropdown must remain unopened until clicked. Make sure that it does not overlap with over components. If needed, a scroll bar must be activate so that proper spacing is maintained. Do not display the names of the squad members in that form after the scrum master selects the squad."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-09
- Q: What should happen when the screen size is smaller than 768px? ‚Üí A: Drawer should use full screen width on mobile devices
- Q: How many squads are expected to be in the dropdown? ‚Üí A: all assigned to the scrummaster
- Q: What happens if the selected squad has no members? ‚Üí A: Allow sprint creation (members can be added later)
- Q: What specific visual elements should match between the "Create New Sprint" and "Create New Squad" drawers? ‚Üí A: Everything including icons and animations
- Q: Are there any performance requirements for drawer opening/closing? ‚Üí A: No specific performance requirements

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Scrum Master, I want the "Create New Sprint" drawer to have a consistent appearance and behavior with the "Create New Squad" drawer, so that the user experience is unified and intuitive across similar functionality.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a Scrum Master is viewing the Sprint tab, **When** they click "Create New Sprint", **Then** the drawer opens with a maximum width of 768px and matches the visual style of the "Create New Squad" drawer
2. **Given** the sprint creation form is open, **When** the Scrum Master views the squad selection dropdown, **Then** the dropdown remains closed until explicitly clicked
3. **Given** the sprint creation form is open, **When** the Scrum Master selects a squad, **Then** squad member names are not displayed in the form
4. **Given** the sprint creation form content exceeds the drawer height, **When** the form is displayed, **Then** a scroll bar activates to maintain proper spacing without overlapping other components

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the screen size is smaller than 768px? ‚Üí Drawer should use full screen width on mobile devices
- How does the form behave when there are many squads in the dropdown? ‚Üí All squads assigned to the Scrum Master are shown
- What happens if the selected squad has no members? ‚Üí Allow sprint creation (members can be added later)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The "Create New Sprint" drawer MUST have a maximum width of 768px on desktop screens, but use full screen width on mobile devices (< 768px)
- **FR-002**: The "Create New Sprint" drawer MUST visually match the "Create New Squad" drawer in all aspects including layout, colors, typography, button styles, icons, and animations
- **FR-003**: The squad selection dropdown in the sprint creation form MUST remain closed until explicitly clicked by the user
- **FR-004**: The sprint creation form MUST NOT display squad member names after a squad is selected
- **FR-005**: The drawer MUST NOT overlap with other page components
- **FR-006**: When form content exceeds available space, a scroll bar MUST activate to maintain proper spacing
- **FR-007**: Sprint creation MUST be allowed even when the selected squad has no members

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: The squad dropdown MUST handle displaying all squads assigned to a Scrum Master without performance degradation

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Sprint**: Represents a time-boxed period for completing work, with attributes like name, start date, end date, and associated squad
- **Squad**: Represents a team of members working together, referenced in sprint creation for assignment
