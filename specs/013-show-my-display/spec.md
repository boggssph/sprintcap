# Feature Specification: Display Name and Profile Picture

**Feature Branch**: `013-show-my-display`  
**Created**: 2025-10-09  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "show my display name next to my display mugshot. there must also be a pencil icon that will allow me to update my display name."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-09
- Q: What are the validation rules for display names? ‚Üí A: 2-25 characters, no special characters except spaces
- Q: How should the display name and profile picture be arranged on mobile devices? ‚Üí A: Hide display name on mobile, show only on larger screens
- Q: What should happen when a display name update fails due to network issues? ‚Üí A: Show error message and keep original name
- Q: What fallback should be shown when no profile picture is available? ‚Üí A: User's initials in a colored circle
- Q: Should screen readers announce the pencil icon's purpose? ‚Üí A: Yes, announce as "Edit display name"

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to see my display name next to my profile picture and be able to easily edit my display name so that I can personalize my profile and ensure my identity is clearly represented in the application.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is logged in and viewing their profile area, **When** they look at their profile picture, **Then** their display name should be visible next to the profile picture
2. **Given** a user wants to change their display name, **When** they click the pencil icon next to their display name, **Then** they should be able to edit and save their new display name
3. **Given** a user has updated their display name, **When** they navigate to different parts of the application, **Then** their updated display name should be consistently displayed
4. **Given** a user is viewing the application on a mobile device, **When** they look at their profile area, **Then** only the profile picture should be visible without the display name
5. **Given** a display name update fails due to network issues, **When** the error occurs, **Then** an error message should be shown and the original name kept

### Edge Cases
- What happens if a user doesn't have a profile picture (avatar fallback: user's initials in a colored circle)?
- How does the display work on mobile devices (display name hidden, only profile picture shown)?
- What validation rules apply to display name changes (2-25 characters, no special characters except spaces)?
- What happens if the display name update fails due to network issues (show error message and keep original name)?
- How should screen readers handle the pencil icon (announce as "Edit display name")?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The user's display name MUST be displayed next to their profile picture/avatar
- **FR-002**: A pencil icon MUST be visible next to the display name to indicate editability
- **FR-003**: Clicking the pencil icon MUST allow the user to edit their display name
- **FR-004**: The display name update MUST be saved and reflected across the application
- **FR-005**: The display name MUST have appropriate validation rules (2-50 characters, no special characters except spaces)
- **FR-006**: The profile picture MUST show appropriate fallback when no image is available (user's initials in a colored circle)
- **FR-007**: On mobile devices, the display name MUST be hidden and only the profile picture shown
- **FR-008**: When display name update fails due to network issues, an error message MUST be shown and the original name kept
- **FR-009**: Screen readers MUST announce the pencil icon as "Edit display name"
- **FR-010**: Display name editing MUST complete within 100ms for responsive user experience
- **FR-011**: Display name input MUST be validated for security (XSS prevention, input sanitization)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User Profile**: Contains display name (2-50 characters, alphanumeric + spaces only), profile picture URL, and other user information. Display name follows validation rules.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Display name editing operations MUST complete within 100ms
- **NFR-002**: Display name input MUST be sanitized to prevent XSS attacks
- **NFR-003**: Profile display MUST be accessible (WCAG AA compliance)
- **NFR-004**: Mobile responsiveness MUST work across devices ‚â•320px width
