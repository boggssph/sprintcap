# Feature Specification: Avatar Display Fix

**Feature Branch**: `016-the-avatar-seem`  
**Created**: October 9, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "the avatar seem to be showing my google avatar and my initial when using firefox. make sure to only display one or the other and i think we have established already that we will always display the google avatar or else we will display the initials."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user viewing my profile avatar, I want to see either my Google profile picture or my initials, but not both simultaneously, so that the avatar display is clean and consistent across different browsers.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has a Google profile picture available, **When** viewing their avatar, **Then** only the Google profile picture should be displayed
2. **Given** a user does not have a Google profile picture available, **When** viewing their avatar, **Then** only their initials should be displayed
3. **Given** a user is viewing their avatar in Firefox, **When** the avatar loads, **Then** it should display consistently (either picture or initials, not both)

### Edge Cases
- **Image Load Failure**: When a Google profile picture fails to load, the system MUST automatically fall back to displaying user initials without showing broken image icons
- **Loading States**: During avatar image loading, the system MUST NOT display both image and initials simultaneously
- **Name Changes**: When a user's display name changes, the initials MUST be recalculated and updated in the avatar display

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: User avatars MUST display either the Google profile picture OR the user initials, but never both simultaneously
- **FR-002**: When a Google profile picture is available, the system MUST display only the profile picture
- **FR-003**: When a Google profile picture is not available, the system MUST display only the user initials
- **FR-004**: Avatar display MUST be consistent across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **FR-005**: User initials MUST be derived from the user's display name or email using the following rules: first letter of first name + first letter of last name (for full names), first two letters of single names, or first two characters of email username (when display name unavailable)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User**: Represents authenticated users with profile information including optional image URL and display name
