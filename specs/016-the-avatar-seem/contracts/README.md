# API Contracts: Avatar Display Fix

**Feature**: `016-the-avatar-seem` | **Date**: October 9, 2025

## Contract Analysis

### No New API Contracts Required

This feature is a **UI-only enhancement** that modifies how existing user profile data is displayed. It does not introduce any new API endpoints, data structures, or external integrations.

### Existing API Contracts Used

The avatar display functionality relies on existing authentication and user profile APIs:

#### NextAuth Session API
- **Purpose**: Provides user session data including profile information
- **Data Structure**: Standard NextAuth session object with user details
- **Fields Used**:
  - `user.image`: Google profile picture URL
  - `user.name`: Display name for initials
  - `user.email`: Email for fallback initials

#### User Profile Data
- **Source**: Existing User model in Prisma schema
- **Access**: Through NextAuth session or direct database queries
- **No Changes**: Existing data structure remains unchanged

### Contract Testing

Since no new contracts are introduced, no new contract tests are required. Existing authentication and user profile contract tests remain valid.

### Integration Points

- **Authentication Flow**: Unchanged - still uses NextAuth
- **User Data Access**: Unchanged - still uses existing User model
- **UI Components**: Enhanced Avatar component logic only

### Backward Compatibility

- **API Contracts**: Fully backward compatible
- **Data Models**: No changes to existing schemas
- **Client Integration**: Existing client code continues to work

## Summary

This feature enhances the user experience by fixing avatar display consistency but does not require any changes to API contracts, data models, or integration patterns. All functionality builds upon existing, well-established contracts.
