# Feature Specification: Show Vercel Deployment Version

**Feature Branch**: `006-the-version-number`  
**Created**: September 30, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "the version number "latest build code" from vercel deployments must be shown. it must be directly retrieved from vercel and not from file that is update somewhere by something."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Description provided: version display from Vercel deployments
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: version display, Vercel integration, dynamic retrieval, no static files
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Clear user flow: display current deployment version from Vercel
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## Clarifications
### Session 2025-09-30
- Q: How should version information refresh frequency be handled? → A: A (Refresh on every page load)
- Q: Which user roles should see the version information? → A: A (All users - authenticated and unauthenticated)
- Q: Where should the version information be displayed on each page? → A: A (Footer of every page)
- Q: What should the fallback message be when Vercel API is unavailable? → A: no fall back
- Q: What is the maximum acceptable latency for version retrieval? → A: A (< 100ms - near-instant)

---
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As any user of the SprintCap application (authenticated or unauthenticated), I want to see the current version/build information from Vercel deployments so that I know I'm using the latest production build and can verify deployments are working correctly.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am on any page of the SprintCap application, **When** I look for version information, **Then** I should see the current Vercel deployment version displayed
2. **Given** a new deployment has been made to Vercel, **When** I access the application, **Then** I should see the updated version information reflecting the latest deployment
3. **Given** the Vercel API is unavailable, **When** I access the application, **Then** I should not see any version information displayed

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the Vercel API returns an error or is temporarily unavailable?
- How does the system handle different deployment environments (production, staging, development)?
- What happens if multiple deployments occur in quick succession?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display the current Vercel deployment version on all application pages
- **FR-002**: System MUST retrieve version information directly from Vercel API on each page load
- **FR-003**: System MUST NOT use static files or cached version information that requires manual updates
- **FR-004**: System MUST hide version information when Vercel API is unavailable (no fallback message)
- **FR-005**: System MUST display version information in the footer of every page for consistent visibility
- **FR-006**: System MUST ensure version retrieval completes within 100ms to maintain user experience

- **FR-007**: System MUST refresh version information on every page load to ensure real-time accuracy

**Design Tradeoff Note**: While FR-002 and FR-007 specify version retrieval/refresh "on each page load", the implementation uses client-side caching with a 30-second TTL to meet the 100ms performance requirement (FR-006). This design decision balances real-time accuracy with user experience and is documented in research.md.
