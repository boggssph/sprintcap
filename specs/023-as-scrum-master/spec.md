# Feature Specification: Sprint Update Functionality

**Feature Branch**: `023-as-scrum-master`  
**Created**: October 11, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "as scrum master I can update the Sprint. there is a button inside the sprint card that will open the drawer to update the sprint. I am able to update the name of the sprint, the sprint start dates and sprint end dates. Sprint start date can only be updated if the new value is not in the past comparing it to system date. For the sprint end date, I will also be able to update if the new value is not in the past comparing it to system date. Inside it I can update the Status of the sprint. I can also see and update the values for the scrum ceremonies of the sprint. you must implement similar drawer to all other implemented drawers."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-11
- Q: What are the valid sprint status transitions? Specifically, can a sprint status be changed from "Completed" back to "Active" or "Inactive"? ‚Üí A: Completed sprints are final - no status changes allowed

### Session: 2025-01-28

**Q1: What happens when a Scrum Master tries to update a sprint that has already ended?**  
**A1: Completed sprints cannot have their status changed.**

**Q2: What validation occurs when updating ceremony times (minimum/maximum values)?**  
**A2: No blanks, no zeros.**

**Q3: How does the system handle concurrent updates to the same sprint by multiple Scrum Masters?**  
**A3: 1 squad = 1 scrummaster.**

**Q4: How are date changes validated when the sprint is currently active?**  
**A4: Compare new value to current system date and do not allow values in the past.**

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Scrum Master, I want to update sprint details so that I can maintain accurate sprint information throughout the sprint lifecycle. This includes updating the sprint name, adjusting dates when needed, changing the sprint status, and modifying ceremony time allocations to reflect current team needs.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am a Scrum Master viewing the Sprint tab, **When** I click the update button on a sprint card, **Then** a drawer opens allowing me to edit sprint details
2. **Given** I am editing a sprint, **When** I update the sprint name, **Then** the change is saved and reflected immediately
3. **Given** I am editing a sprint, **When** I set a start date that is not in the past, **Then** the date is accepted and saved
4. **Given** I am editing a sprint, **When** I try to set a start date that is in the past, **Then** the system prevents the change and shows an error message "Start date cannot be in the past for active sprints"
5. **Given** I am editing a sprint, **When** I set an end date that is not in the past, **Then** the date is accepted and saved
6. **Given** I am editing a sprint, **When** I try to set an end date that is in the past, **Then** the system prevents the change and shows an error message "End date cannot be in the past"
7. **Given** I am editing a sprint, **When** I change the sprint status from "planned" to "active", **Then** the new status is saved and reflected in the UI
8. **Given** I am editing a sprint, **When** I try to change a "completed" sprint status, **Then** the system prevents the change and shows an error message "Completed sprints cannot be modified"
9. **Given** I am editing a sprint, **When** I update ceremony time values to positive numbers, **Then** the changes are saved and applied to the sprint
10. **Given** I am editing a sprint, **When** I try to set ceremony time to 0 or blank, **Then** the system prevents the change and shows an error message "Ceremony time must be greater than 0"

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a Scrum Master tries to update a sprint that has already ended? [Completed sprints cannot have their status changed]
- How does the system handle concurrent updates to the same sprint by multiple Scrum Masters?
- What validation occurs when updating ceremony times (minimum/maximum values)?
- How are date changes validated when the sprint is currently active?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow Scrum Masters to access an update drawer from sprint cards in the Sprint tab
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow Scrum Masters to update sprint names
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow Scrum Masters to update sprint start dates, but only accept dates that are not in the past
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow Scrum Masters to update sprint end dates, but only accept dates that are not in the past
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow Scrum Masters to update sprint status (planned, active, completed), but completed sprints cannot be changed to any other status
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow Scrum Masters to view and update scrum ceremony time allocations for the sprint
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate that date changes do not violate business rules (no past dates)
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide clear, specific error messages when invalid data is entered (e.g., "Start date cannot be in the past for active sprints", "Ceremony time must be greater than 0", "Completed sprints cannot be modified")
- **FR-009**: System MUST save all changes immediately when submitted
- **FR-010**: System MUST update the UI to reflect changes after successful saves
- **FR-011**: System MUST authenticate users and authorize only Scrum Masters to access sprint update functionality
- **FR-012**: System MUST verify that the authenticated Scrum Master belongs to the squad that owns the sprint being updated

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Sprint update operations MUST complete within 500ms (P95) for optimal user experience
- **NFR-002**: System MUST maintain WCAG AA accessibility compliance for all update forms and error messages
- **NFR-003**: Update drawer MUST be fully responsive and functional on mobile devices (< 768px width)
- **NFR-004**: System MUST prevent concurrent updates to the same sprint by multiple users (1 Scrum Master per squad constraint)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Sprint**: Represents a time-boxed period of work with attributes for name, dates, status, and ceremony configurations
- **Scrum Master**: User role with permissions to manage sprint details
- **Scrum Ceremony**: Time allocations for different ceremony types (daily scrum, planning, review, retrospective, refinement)
