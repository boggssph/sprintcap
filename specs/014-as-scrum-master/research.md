# Research Findings: Squads Tab Redesign

**Feature**: 014-as-scrum-master
**Date**: October 9, 2025

## Drawer Component Behavior on Mobile Devices

**Decision**: Use full-screen drawer behavior on mobile devices
**Rationale**: Provides better UX on small screens, follows mobile app patterns, ensures form is fully visible
**Alternatives considered**:
- Partial height drawer: Less usable on mobile, form might be cramped
- Modal dialog: Less mobile-friendly, doesn't follow platform conventions

**Implementation**: shadcn/ui Drawer component automatically handles responsive behavior

## Confirmation Dialog UX Patterns

**Decision**: Show confirmation dialog when user attempts to navigate away from open drawer
**Rationale**: Prevents accidental data loss, follows web app best practices for unsaved changes
**Alternatives considered**:
- Auto-save drafts: Adds unnecessary complexity for simple form
- No confirmation: Poor UX, user could lose work accidentally
- Toast warning: Less intrusive but might be missed

**Implementation**: Use browser beforeunload event or React Router navigation guards

## Empty State Design Patterns

**Decision**: Centered empty state with descriptive text and prominent CTA button
**Rationale**: Clear call-to-action, follows established design patterns, guides user to next action
**Alternatives considered**:
- Minimal empty state: Less discoverable, user might not know what to do
- Auto-create first squad: Unexpected behavior, removes user agency
- Hide empty state: Confusing, user won't understand why nothing shows

**Implementation**: Use shadcn/ui empty state patterns with centered layout

## Inline Error Message Positioning

**Decision**: Display error messages directly below form fields
**Rationale**: Clear association between error and field, follows form UX best practices
**Alternatives considered**:
- Toast notifications: Errors might be missed, no field association
- Top of form summary: Less direct, harder to associate with specific fields
- Modal error dialog: Disrupts workflow, less efficient

**Implementation**: Add error state to form fields with red text below input
