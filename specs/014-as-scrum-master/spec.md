# Feature Specification: Squads Tab Redesign

**Feature Branch**: `014-as-scrum-master`
**Created**: October 9, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "As scrum master, in my dashboard, I want to see only the list of squads when I click on the "Squads" tab. But we shall have a CTA button for "Create New Squad" that will open a drawer showing the form to create a new squad. The "Create New Squad" button will only appear within the "Squad" tab."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-09
- Q: What happens when a Scrum Master has no squads yet? ‚Üí A: Show empty state with helpful message and prominent "Create New Squad" button
- Q: How should failed squad creation attempts be handled? ‚Üí A: Show inline error message below form fields
- Q: What happens if the drawer is opened but the user navigates away (changes tabs)? ‚Üí A: Show confirmation dialog before closing
- Q: Should the squads list show any additional information beyond name/alias/member count? ‚Üí A: Just name, alias, and member count
- Q: How should the drawer behave on mobile devices? ‚Üí A: Full screen drawer (standard mobile UX)

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Scrum Master, I want to see a clean list of my squads when I click on the "Squads" tab in my dashboard, with a clear call-to-action button to create new squads, so that I can efficiently manage my teams without visual clutter.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am a Scrum Master viewing my dashboard, **When** I click on the "Squads" tab, **Then** I should see only the list of squads and a "Create New Squad" button
2. **Given** I am viewing the Squads tab, **When** I click the "Create New Squad" button, **Then** a drawer should open containing the squad creation form
3. **Given** I have the squad creation drawer open, **When** I successfully create a squad, **Then** the drawer should close and the squads list should refresh
4. **Given** I am viewing the Sprints tab, **When** I look for the "Create New Squad" button, **Then** it should not be visible
5. **Given** I am a Scrum Master with no squads, **When** I click on the "Squads" tab, **Then** I should see an empty state with helpful message and prominent "Create New Squad" button
6. **Given** I attempt to create a squad with invalid data, **When** the creation fails, **Then** I should see inline error messages below the form fields
7. **Given** I have the squad creation drawer open, **When** I attempt to navigate to another tab, **Then** I should see a confirmation dialog asking if I want to close the drawer

### Edge Cases
- When a Scrum Master has no squads yet, show empty state with helpful message and prominent "Create New Squad" button
- Failed squad creation attempts show inline error message below form fields
- If drawer is opened but user navigates away (changes tabs), show confirmation dialog before closing
- Drawer behaves as full screen on mobile devices (standard mobile UX)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display only the squads list when Scrum Master clicks "Squads" tab
- **FR-002**: System MUST show a "Create New Squad" call-to-action button within the Squads tab only
- **FR-003**: System MUST open a drawer containing the squad creation form when "Create New Squad" button is clicked
- **FR-004**: System MUST close the drawer and refresh the squads list after successful squad creation
- **FR-005**: System MUST NOT display the "Create New Squad" button in any other dashboard tabs
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain existing squad creation form functionality within the drawer
- **FR-007**: System MUST show empty state with helpful message and prominent "Create New Squad" button when Scrum Master has no squads
- **FR-008**: System MUST show inline error messages below form fields for failed squad creation attempts
- **FR-009**: System MUST show confirmation dialog before closing drawer when user attempts to navigate away
- **FR-010**: System MUST display drawer as full screen on mobile devices
- **FR-011**: System MUST display squads list showing only name, alias, and member count

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Squad**: Represents a team with attributes like name, alias, and member count
- **Scrum Master**: User role that owns and manages squads
