# Feature Specification: Copyright Text Alignment

**Feature Branch**: `012-the-copyright-text`  
**Created**: 2025-10-09  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "the copyright text area must left align vertically with the header"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user viewing the application, I want the copyright text to be properly aligned with the header so that the interface appears clean and professional.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is viewing any page with a footer containing copyright text, **When** they look at the layout, **Then** the copyright text should be left-aligned vertically with the header content above it
2. **Given** the application is displayed on different screen sizes, **When** the layout adjusts responsively, **Then** the copyright text alignment should remain consistent with the header

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the header content changes dynamically?
- How does the alignment work on mobile devices with different header layouts?
- What happens if the copyright text wraps to multiple lines?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The copyright text area MUST be left-aligned vertically with the header content
- **FR-002**: The alignment MUST remain consistent across different screen sizes and responsive breakpoints
- **FR-003**: The alignment MUST be maintained when header content changes dynamically [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what header content can change dynamically?]
- **FR-004**: The copyright text MUST remain readable and properly positioned when it wraps to multiple lines [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: how should multi-line copyright text be handled?]
