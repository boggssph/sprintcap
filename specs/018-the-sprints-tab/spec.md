# Feature Specification: Sprints Tab Display

**Feature Branch**: `018-the-sprints-tab`  
**Created**: 2025-10-09  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "The Sprints tab, when clicked should display Squads cards, each card will show the list of last 3 sprints of which top on the list is the active or most recent sprint. it will show the Sprint start date and Sprint End Date opposite to the Sprint Name. There is also a CTA button for the "Create New Sprint", layout is similar to that of the Squads tab. The Create New Sprint form will now be shown inside the drawer component, similar to that of the Create New Squad form."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-09
- Q: How should the system determine which sprint is "active" versus "most recent"? ‚Üí A: Active sprint = current date falls within sprint start/end dates
- Q: Which user roles should have access to view the Sprints tab? ‚Üí A: Only Scrum Masters
- Q: What key attributes should each sprint display beyond name, start date, and end date? ‚Üí A: Nothing else
- Q: What should happen when a user has no squads to manage? ‚Üí A: Show empty state with message and "Create Squad" CTA
- Q: Should sprints be sorted by end date (descending) or creation date (descending)? ‚Üí A: Sort by start date (upcoming sprints first)

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Scrum Master, I want to view all sprints organized by squad so that I can quickly see the current sprint status and recent sprint history for each squad I manage. Only Scrum Masters have access to this feature.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am a Scrum Master viewing the Sprints tab, **When** I click on the Sprints tab, **Then** I should see cards for each squad I have access to
2. **Given** I am viewing a squad card in the Sprints tab, **When** the card loads, **Then** I should see the last 3 sprints for that squad with the active sprint (current date falls within start/end dates) listed first, followed by upcoming sprints sorted by start date
3. **Given** I am viewing sprint information in a squad card, **When** I look at each sprint entry, **Then** I should see the sprint name with start date and end date displayed opposite to the name
4. **Given** I am viewing the Sprints tab, **When** I look for a way to create new sprints, **Then** I should see a "Create New Sprint" call-to-action button
5. **Given** I click the "Create New Sprint" button, **When** the form opens, **Then** it should appear in a drawer component similar to the Create New Squad form
6. **Given** I am a Scrum Master with no squads to manage, **When** I access the Sprints tab, **Then** I should see an empty state with a message and "Create Squad" call-to-action button

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a squad has fewer than 3 sprints?
- How does the system determine which sprint is "active" vs "most recent"? (Active = current date falls within sprint start/end dates)
- What happens if a user doesn't have access to any squads? (Show empty state with "Create Squad" CTA)
- How are sprints ordered when there are exactly 3 sprints? (Active sprint first, then by start date ascending)
- What happens when multiple sprints overlap in time?
- How should past sprints be displayed vs future sprints?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a Sprints tab in the navigation
- **FR-002**: System MUST show squad cards when the Sprints tab is clicked
- **FR-003**: Each squad card MUST display the last 3 sprints for that squad
- **FR-004**: System MUST display the active sprint (current date falls within start/end dates) at the top of each squad's sprint list, followed by upcoming sprints sorted by start date
- **FR-005**: Each sprint entry MUST show the sprint name with start date and end date displayed opposite to the name
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide a "Create New Sprint" call-to-action button
- **FR-007**: The "Create New Sprint" form MUST open in a drawer component
- **FR-008**: The Create New Sprint drawer MUST have similar layout and behavior to the Create New Squad drawer
- **FR-009**: System MUST only show squads that the current Scrum Master has access to manage
- **FR-010**: System MUST display an empty state with message and "Create Squad" CTA when Scrum Master has no squads to manage

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Sprint**: Represents a time-boxed development period with name, start date, end date, and associated squad
- **Squad**: Represents a team that can have multiple sprints associated with it
