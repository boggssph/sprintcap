# Research Findings: Sprints Tab Display

## Sprint Data Model Research

**Decision**: Sprint entity with name, start_date, end_date, and squad_id fields
**Rationale**: Based on existing Squad model pattern, minimal required fields for sprint tracking
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Adding status field (rejected: status can be computed from dates)
- Adding description field (rejected: keep minimal for MVP)

## Active Sprint Determination Logic

**Decision**: Active sprint = current date falls within sprint start/end dates
**Rationale**: Simple, deterministic logic that matches business requirements
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Explicit "active" flag (rejected: adds complexity, potential for stale data)
- Most recent sprint regardless of dates (rejected: doesn't match "active" concept)

## Sprint Sorting and Display Logic

**Decision**: Display active sprint first, then upcoming sprints sorted by start_date ascending
**Rationale**: Prioritizes current work while showing future planning
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Chronological by start date only (rejected: doesn't highlight active work)
- Alphabetical by name (rejected: not useful for planning)

## UI Component Patterns

**Decision**: Follow existing SquadCreationDrawer pattern for SprintCreationDrawer
**Rationale**: Maintains consistency with existing drawer implementations
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Modal dialog (rejected: drawer pattern already established)
- Inline form (rejected: drawer provides better UX for complex forms)

## API Design Patterns

**Decision**: RESTful endpoints following existing squad API patterns
**Rationale**: Consistency with existing codebase architecture
**Alternatives Considered**:
- GraphQL (rejected: REST already established, no complex relationships needed)

## Database Schema Extensions

**Decision**: Add Sprint model to existing Prisma schema
**Rationale**: Follows existing ORM patterns and migration strategy
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Separate database (rejected: single database already established)

## Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Unit tests for components, integration tests for API, E2E tests for user flows
**Rationale**: Comprehensive coverage following existing test patterns
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Minimal testing (rejected: violates constitutional testing requirements)

## Performance Considerations

**Decision**: Single query to fetch sprints with squad filtering
**Rationale**: Efficient data loading for dashboard display
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Lazy loading (rejected: overkill for small dataset, adds complexity)

## Accessibility Requirements

**Decision**: WCAG AA compliance with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
**Rationale**: Constitutional requirement for accessibility
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Basic accessibility (rejected: constitutional requirement for AA level)

## Responsive Design Approach

**Decision**: Mobile-first responsive design using Tailwind breakpoints
**Rationale**: Constitutional responsive-first requirement
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Desktop-first (rejected: violates constitutional responsive-first approach)
