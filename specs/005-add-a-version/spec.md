# Feature Specification: Add Version Number Display

**Feature Branch**: `005-add-a-version`  
**Created**: 2025-09-29  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "add a version number in the landing page below the line where it shows "Built with focus ‚Äî minimal dependencies." while in the authenticated session, display it under the sign out CTA button. make it tiny size, maybe font size 8."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-29
- Q: What is the source and format of the version number? ‚Üí A: Git commit hash or tag (e.g., "abc1234" or "v1.0.0-5-gabc1234")
- Q: What should happen when the version number cannot be determined or loaded? ‚Üí A: Display a fallback message like "Version unavailable"
- Q: Should the version number be visible to all user roles, or only specific roles? ‚Üí A: Visible to all users (authenticated and non-authenticated)
- Q: What is the exact font size specification for the version number? ‚Üí A: 6
- Q: How should the version number display behave on mobile devices? ‚Üí A: Smaller font size on mobile

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user visiting the landing page, I want to see the application version number so that I can identify which version of the application I'm using.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user visits the landing page without being authenticated, **When** they view the page content, **Then** they should see the version number displayed below the "Built with focus ‚Äî minimal dependencies." text
2. **Given** a user is authenticated and viewing the landing page, **When** they look for the sign out button, **Then** they should see the version number displayed below the sign out CTA button
3. **Given** the version number is displayed, **When** users view it, **Then** it should appear in a small font size (approximately 8px) that is unobtrusive but readable

### Edge Cases
- When the version number cannot be determined or loaded, display a fallback message "Version unavailable"
- On mobile devices, display the version number with a smaller font size than desktop
- What happens if the "Built with focus ‚Äî minimal dependencies." text changes or is removed?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display the application version number on the landing page for all users
- **FR-002**: System MUST display the version number below the "Built with focus ‚Äî minimal dependencies." text for non-authenticated users
- **FR-003**: System MUST display the version number below the sign out CTA button for authenticated users
- **FR-004**: System MUST display the version number in a small font size (6px) to keep it unobtrusive
- **FR-005**: System MUST ensure the version number is visible and readable despite the small font size

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Version**: Represents the current application version, consisting of a git commit hash or tag (e.g., "abc1234" or "v1.0.0-5-gabc1234") that identifies the release
