# Feature Specification: Squad Member Display Bug Fix

**Feature Branch**: `008-bug-found-there`
**Created**: October 2, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Bug Found: There are 2 members in the FMBS squad but none of these members are listed in the Members section of the choosen/selected squad (FMBS). So if I switch to a selectd squad, I expect it to be listing members all of that squad only (if at least 1 is there, if none show No Members Found)."

## Clarifications
### Session 2025-10-02
- Q: How do squads and members relate in the data model? → A: One squad has many members (one-to-many)
- Q: How are members uniquely identified across squads? → A: By email address
- Q: What constitutes a "large number of members" for performance considerations? → A: More than 10 members per squad
- Q: How should the UI behave during member data loading? → A: Show a loading spinner in the Members section
- Q: What should happen if member data fails to load? → A: Show error message and allow retry

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Bug report about squad member display functionality
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: squad selection, member display, filtering by squad
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → No ambiguities found - clear bug description
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Clear user flow: select squad → see only that squad's members
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → No ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   → Squads and Members entities are involved
7. Run Review Checklist
   → No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
   → No implementation details found
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Scrum Master, when I select a squad in the sprint creation form, I want to see only the members of that selected squad in the Members section, so I can understand which team members will be automatically added to the sprint.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am on the sprint creation page, **When** I select the "FMBS" squad (which has 2 members), **Then** I should see exactly 2 members listed in the Members section
2. **Given** I have selected a squad with members, **When** I switch to a different squad, **Then** I should see only the members of the newly selected squad
3. **Given** I select a squad that has no active members, **When** the squad is selected, **Then** I should see "No Members Found" in the Members section

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a squad has only inactive members?
- How does the system handle squads with a large number of members (performance)?
- What happens if a user switches squads rapidly?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display only members of the currently selected squad in the Members section
- **FR-002**: System MUST update the Members section immediately when a different squad is selected
- **FR-003**: System MUST show "No Members Found" when the selected squad has no active members
- **FR-004**: System MUST show the correct member count for each squad in the squad selection dropdown
- **FR-005**: System MUST filter members by active status when displaying squad members
- **FR-006**: System MUST show a loading spinner in the Members section while member data is being fetched
- **FR-007**: System MUST show an error message and allow retry when member data fails to load

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: System MUST display member lists within 2 seconds for squads with up to 10 members
- **NFR-002**: System MUST handle squads with more than 10 members without performance degradation

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Squad**: Represents a team with a name, alias, and collection of members
- **Member**: Represents a team member with active/inactive status and email address (unique identifier), belonging to one squad
- **Relationship**: One squad has many members (one-to-many)
