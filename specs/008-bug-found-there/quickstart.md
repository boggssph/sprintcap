# Quickstart: Squad Member Display Bug Fix

## Overview
This guide validates that the squad member display bug fix is working correctly. The bug was that the Members section showed all members regardless of the selected squad.

## Prerequisites
- SprintCap application running locally
- At least one squad with multiple members exists
- User has Scrum Master role for the squad(s)

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Squad Selection Filtering
1. **Navigate** to `/setup/scrum-master` (sprint creation page)
2. **Observe** the squad dropdown shows squads with member counts
3. **Select** a squad that has members (e.g., "FMBS" with 2 members)
4. **Verify** the Members section shows exactly the members of that squad
5. **Select** a different squad
6. **Verify** the Members section updates to show only members of the new squad

### Scenario 2: Empty Squad Handling
1. **Select** a squad with no active members
2. **Verify** "No Members Found" appears in the Members section
3. **Select** a squad with members again
4. **Verify** members are displayed correctly

### Scenario 3: Loading States
1. **Select** a squad with members
2. **Observe** loading spinner appears briefly in Members section
3. **Verify** members load and display within 2 seconds

### Scenario 4: Error Handling
1. **Simulate** network failure (disconnect internet briefly)
2. **Select** a squad
3. **Verify** error message appears with retry option
4. **Click** retry button
5. **Verify** members load successfully when connection restored

## Expected Behavior

### ✅ Correct Behavior (After Fix)
- Members section shows only members of selected squad
- Loading spinner during data fetch
- "No Members Found" for empty squads
- Error message with retry for failures
- Fast loading (< 2 seconds) for squads ≤ 10 members

### ❌ Bug Behavior (Before Fix)
- Members section shows all members regardless of squad selection
- No loading states
- No error handling
- Potential performance issues with large member lists

## Validation Checklist

### Functional Validation
- [ ] Squad selection filters members correctly
- [ ] Empty squads show "No Members Found"
- [ ] Loading states provide good UX
- [ ] Error handling allows recovery
- [ ] Member counts in dropdown match actual members

### Performance Validation
- [ ] Loading completes within 2 seconds for small squads
- [ ] No performance degradation with larger squads
- [ ] Smooth squad switching without delays

### UX Validation
- [ ] Loading spinner is visible and not jarring
- [ ] Error messages are clear and actionable
- [ ] Member list is readable and well-formatted
- [ ] No layout shifts during loading

## Troubleshooting

### Members Not Filtering
- Check browser network tab for API calls to `/api/squads/[id]/members`
- Verify user has Scrum Master role for the squad
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors

### Loading Issues
- Verify internet connection
- Check if API endpoint returns 500 errors
- Look for database connection issues in server logs

### Performance Problems
- Check member count per squad (should be ≤ 100)
- Verify database indexes are in place
- Monitor network latency

## Success Criteria
- All test scenarios pass
- No console errors during normal operation
- Performance meets targets
- UX is smooth and intuitive

## Next Steps
Once validated, the feature is ready for:
1. **Unit Testing**: Run component and API tests
2. **Integration Testing**: End-to-end validation
3. **Production Deployment**: Merge and deploy to production
