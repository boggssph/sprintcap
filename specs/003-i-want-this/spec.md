# Feature Specification: Simple Google Sign-in and Role-directed Flow

**Feature Branch**: `003-i-want-this`  
**Created**: 2025-09-28  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want this kind of login screen, simple, clean, elegant and no extra steps.. when the user click on the cta button \"continue with google\" it then does the Google OAuth, when successfully authenticated, our code checks of the account is already in our datase, if yes, then allow to continue to the flow either squad member or scrum master and load the proper pages allowed for the user."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-28
- Q: For unknown accounts after successful Google OAuth, should we (A) Block, (B) Create pending, (C) Auto-create, or (D) Auto-create with first-user promotion? ‚Üí A
- Q: For canonical role names and mappings, choose one: (A) SCRUM_MASTER/MEMBER, (B) ADMIN/SCRUM_MASTER/MEMBER, (C) prefixed role names, or (D) flexible string + flag. ‚Üí B
- Q: On initial bootstrap, what to do with the very first registered user? (A) No auto-promotion, (B) Promote first to SCRUM_MASTER, (C) Promote first to ADMIN, (D) Require explicit bootstrap confirmation. ‚Üí C


## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. User visits the public sign-in page and clicks the CTA "Continue with Google".
2. The client triggers Google OAuth sign-in via the app's authentication provider.
3. Google completes OAuth and redirects the user back to the site's auth callback.
4. Server-side callback handler validates the code, exchanges tokens, and retrieves user profile (email, name, picture).
5. Server-side code checks the database for an existing account matching the provider id or email.
   - If a matching account exists, evaluate the user's role (ADMIN, SCRUM_MASTER, MEMBER) and apply role-scoped routing/permissions. SCRUM_MASTER has elevated privileges within their scope; ADMIN has global control.
   - If no account exists, reject access (or optionally create a pending/invite record) ‚Äî see [NEEDS CLARIFICATION].
6. After successful role resolution, issue a session and redirect the user into the application flow appropriate for their role.
   - If this is the first registered user in the database (no existing users), automatically assign role = ADMIN and grant global admin privileges.
7. Client-side session-aware pages render the appropriate UI and navigation based on the user's role/permissions.
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- Goal: Minimal friction sign-in using Google OAuth. No extra steps for the user beyond consent.
- UX: A single, centered CTA card (Continue with Google). After consent the user lands inside the app immediately if authorized.
- Security: Server validates OAuth tokens and ensures the returned email or provider id is mapped to an accepted account in the app database.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user with an invited account, I want to click "Continue with Google", complete Google OAuth, and be taken directly to the part of the app I'm allowed to access (squad member screens or scrum master screens) without additional steps.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given an invited Scrum Master account exists, when the user signs in via Google with that email, then the system creates/returns a session and redirects the user into the Scrum Master onboarding/dashboard flow.
2. Given an invited Squad Member account exists, when the user signs in via Google with that email, then the system creates/returns a session and redirects the user into the Squad Member flow.
3. Given no matching account exists, when the user signs in with Google, then the system DENIES ACCESS and shows a clear "Not invited" explanatory message with instructions to request access. (Clarified behavior: unknown accounts are blocked ‚Äî option A)
4. Given the OAuth exchange fails or token validation fails, when the user is redirected back, then the system shows an error and does not create a session.

### Edge Cases
- Google account uses a different email alias than the one on file (e.g., plus-addressing). System must match canonical email or provider id.
- User revokes consent at Google's consent screen; the app must show an error and not create a session.
- Network or token-exchange failures: show a transient error and allow retry.
- If multiple local accounts map to the same Google email, determine precedence (should be prevented at account creation time). [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- FR-001: The system MUST present a single-page sign-in UI with a prominent "Continue with Google" CTA.
- FR-002: Clicking the CTA MUST initiate Google OAuth and redirect to Google's consent screen.
- FR-003: The server MUST securely handle the OAuth callback, exchange the code for tokens, and fetch the user's email and basic profile.
- FR-004: The server MUST check whether the returned Google profile (provider id or email) maps to an existing user account in the database.
- FR-005: If a matching account exists, the server MUST create a session and redirect the user to the appropriate flow based on role (ADMIN ‚Üí admin flow, SCRUM_MASTER ‚Üí scrum flow, MEMBER ‚Üí member flow). Role determines allowed pages and actions.
- FR-006: If no matching account exists, the server MUST reject access and return a clear "Not invited" message with next steps (do not auto-create accounts).
- FR-010: On initial bootstrap (no existing users), the server MUST automatically create the first user with role = ADMIN and grant full administrative privileges.
- FR-007: The client MUST update its UI upon return from the OAuth callback to reflect authenticated state (no stale sign-in buttons).
- FR-008: The authentication flow MUST not leak secrets or tokens to the client; tokens are stored server-side and session is maintained securely (HTTP-only cookie or JWT as configured).
- FR-009: The system MUST log authentication events (success/failure) for auditing.

*Ambiguities explicitly marked below.*

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User**: Primary account record (id, email, name, role [ADMIN|SCRUM_MASTER|MEMBER], providerId, createdAt). Role values: ADMIN, SCRUM_MASTER, MEMBER.
- **Invite / Membership**: (inviteId, email, squadId, role, status) ‚Äî represents invited accounts.

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs
